## Notes for instructor
I used external CSS for the Blockquote(referenced above), but I have complete understanding of what each CSS line does. Since design was not the primarily goal of this project I assumed it's ok, I noticed that in the example bootstrap was used to style the quote, but I did not want to link bootstrap just for the styling of the Blockquote. Hope that works.
